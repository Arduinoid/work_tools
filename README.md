# Tools for work #
This random set of tools are things that I make to help with work projects.
## Multi-watermark.py ##
> This little script is used to replicate an image located in the same directory as the script. It will then add a watermark to each image generated. This watermark will then have a different position in each iteration of the image created. </br></br>
This is so that each image would be considered unique optically as well as the check sum of the file. TO the naked eye, you would not be able to tell the images were different from one another.

## Make_directory.py ##
> This script was made to create a custom directory tree for the images of products being shot and stored. The script is interactive and will prompt the user for info regarding the product. This information is used to setup a custom directory tree that best suites the organization of images.
